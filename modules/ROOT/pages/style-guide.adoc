= Style guide

The style guide acts as a neutral arbiter of 'the right way' to write for this project.
This helps to ensure a consistent standard and to minimise edits and rework -- which is especially important for a project which will involve multiple authors who work at different times and places.

With proper use, the style guide helps us to:

* *BeÂ consistent*.
We avoid inconsistencies that confuse or annoy readers.
* *Reduce confrontation*, because the authority lies with the style guide.
People tend to think that their way of writing something is the best way -- but we don't all agree.
The style guide acts as a neutral arbiter of style.
This makes it easier for us to set aside personal preferences and biases.
* *Raise the level of trust among contributors*.
It is easier to collaborate on content when everyone works to the same conventions without heated debate over trivia.
	
And, writing to a consistent style means:

* *Fewer edits, less rework*.
We produce high quality content more quickly.
* *Faster onboarding*.
New contributors can quickly understand and meet expectations.
* *Better content*.
We avoid ambiguity and common mistakes, so that the publication is easy to understand and free of needless distractions.
