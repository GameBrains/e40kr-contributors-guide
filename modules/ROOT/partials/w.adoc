== web; Web

* When you use the word as a modifier, use lower case and separate words ([green]#web address#; [green]#web page#; [green]#web application#; [green]#web services#). 
* However, it is usual to write some terms as single words: [green]#website#; [green]#webcam#; [green]#webmaster#; [green]#webcast#.
* If you refer to [green]#*the* Web#, capitalise as you would for any other pronoun -- and by extension, capitalise concepts like [green]#Web 2.0#. 
* Note that 'the Web' is *not* interchangeable with 'the Internet' -- the Web (formally, the World Wide Web) depends upon the Internet, but the reverse is not true.
