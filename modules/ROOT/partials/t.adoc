== titles (for documents and topics)

See https://motivecontent.com/resources/moco/style-guide/titles-and-headings.html[Titles and headings^] and https://motivecontent.com/resources/moco/style-guide/topic-titles-and-topic-file-names.html[Topic titles and topic file names^] (external URLs).

== toward; towards

Either is acceptable, but favour [green]#towards# as it is more common in UK English.

== trademarks

Check the spelling and capitalisation of trademarks and brands, and use them correctly.
Do not use a trademark as a verb ([green]#search for it#, not [red]#google it#).

Symbols like (TM) and (R) can be useful where appropriate, but don't overdo it -- on the first mention should be enough in most cases.
