Use only standard capitalisation, also known as sentence case. 
Never use title case or full upper case for headings.

== hyphens

* Hyphenate two-part words where it makes sense to separate repeated vowels ([green]#co-operate#; [green]#pre-eminent#; [green]#pre-empt#; [green]#re-entry#).
* Do not use a hyphen where you should use a semi-colon, colon, em dash or en dash -- each has its own purpose, so learn to use them as outlined in this guide.
