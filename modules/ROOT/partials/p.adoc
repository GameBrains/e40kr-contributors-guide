== passive case

Do not use passive case, except where there really is no better way -- which there usually is unless you have a specific need to be vague about agency.
Instead, use the active case, usually in the imperative, and in the first or second person.

It should always be clear who or what is the 'actor' in the sentence.
For rules, assume that the reader is the primary actor even though they might actually read the rules to check what their opponent may or may not do.

.Active case, not passive case
====
First person: [green]#We will release#, not [red]#It will be released#.

Second person, imperative: [green]#Check that there are no dice on the floor#, not [red]#It is recommended that the player checks underfoot for dice#.

Second person as the primary actor: [green]#When you shoot with this weapon#, not [red]#When a player shoots with this weapon#.

== percent

See <<symbols_percent>>.

== plugin; plug in

_plugin_ = noun, as in a software component that extends functionality ([green]#I like the flow chart plugin#).

_plug in_ = phrasal verb.
Avoid phrasal verbs, and use a clearer alternative ([green]#plug your charger into your phone#, not [red]#plug in your charger#).
 
== plurals

Don't use an apostrophe to pluralise an abbreviation -- unless the abbreviation ends with an *s*.
Even then, it is often better to add the appropriate plural noun ([green]#Automated SOS messages#, not [red]#Automated SOSâ€™s#).
See also <<abbreviations>>.

For the possessive on a plural, see <<apostrophes>>.
 
== practice; practise

_practice_ = noun ([green]#with regular practice, the rules become easy to remember#).
_practise_ = verb ([green]#you can practise a variety of tactics#).
