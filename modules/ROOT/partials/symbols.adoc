= Symbols

== & (ampersand)

Avoid, except where it is specifically used in a brand name or trademark, or in rare cases where we are limited by the available space. 
 
== / (forward slash)

Where you use this symbol to mean _either_ (as in [green]#and/or#), do not surround it with spaces.

[[symbols_percent]]
== % (percent)

Use the [green]#%# symbol, not the word [red]#percent#.
If you are compelled to spell it out for some reason then note that both _percent_ and _per cent_ are acceptable -- but let's favour [green]#percent#, to be consistent.
